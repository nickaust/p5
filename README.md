# Project 5: Full-Stack Browser Game
## Purpose: I created an interactive game using OOP and full-stack JavaScript.
## What I learned:
- Class-based programming with this and methods
- Array methods (map, forEach) and destructuring
- Building Express servers with static files
- Client-side API calls and DOM updates
- Each project built on the last, moving from terminal basics to full-stack development while emphasizing clean code and practical tooling.
